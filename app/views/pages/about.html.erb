          My name is Christopher Choi and I am a web developer with experience mainly in Ruby(on Rails),
          but have tinkered with Elixir(Phoenix) and ELM.
        </p>
        <p>
          My developer experience started with my first job out of college at a small(now large) medical startup company.
          I first started out in customer success team and tinkered with code after seeing our 2 person dev team create a massive SaaS product.
          I dove headfirst into Ruby on Rails, the same stack that was utilized to build an enterprise level application.
          Although I am now trying to diversify my skil set, Ruby will always have a special place in my heart.
          Special shoutout to Drew and Loren for inspiring me to go further in code, thank you!
