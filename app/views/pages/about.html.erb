            My name is Christopher Choi and I am a web developer with experience mainly in Ruby(on Rails),
            but have tinkered with Elixir(Phoenix) and ELM.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first started out in customer success right out of college and my company at the time utilized Rails.
            Since then, I taught myself how to code with the help/inspiration from the dev team.
            Although I am now trying to diversify my skil set, Ruby will always have a special place in my heart.
            Special shoutout to Drew and Loren for inspiring me to go further in code, thank you!
