<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">
  My name is Christopher Choi and I am a web developer with experience mainly in Ruby(on Rails),
  but have tinkered with Elixir(Phoenix) and ELM.
</p>
<p>
  My developer experience started with my first job out of college at a small(now large) medical startup company.
  I first started out in a customer success team and tinkered in code after seeing our dev team create a truly amazing product.
  I dove headfirst into Ruby on Rails, the same stack that was utilized to build an amazing enterprise level application.
  Although I am now trying to diversify my skil set, Ruby will always have a special place in my heart.
  Special shoutout to Drew and Loren for inspiring me to go further in code, thank you!
